## Introduction
 A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed. It is possible in some situations that the patient is unable to get the required amount of blood at right time due to lack of interrelationship in form of a networked database among the blood banks which leads to the lack of knowledge of updated record of all blood stocks

## Research
As per the information obtained from blood bank and hospital we had understood the following working system of blood bank. There is growing need of blood but one cannot produce blood in laboratory. Blood bank and hospital are depending on the blood donated by the donors. So, to promote donors to donate blood. Blood bank and hospital organize blood donation Camps or one can call donors by calling them by the Phone number provided by the donor in the form. The existing system is the manual system in which the donors first visit the hospital. In existing system, the blood bank management system exhibited at a lot of ineffectiveness and inefficiency that had fetched impact taken by management. The system which was manual that is based on paper card to collect blood donor data, keep record of blood donors and disseminate results to blood donors, had weakness that needed IT based solutions.
## Cost and Features
- Since the system uses only open source software, it is free of cost..!!
- Features: Login ,Blood stocks update by Blood Bank,Web based stock lookup for user,Organize Blood Campaign.

## Defining Our System
    -- TBD
